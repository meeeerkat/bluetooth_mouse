## A bluetooth mouse peripheric made with an ESP32 devkit and some cables

### Current state
Moving the cursor and clicking (right and left clicks) work right now
Using a potentiometer on GPIO34 can set the cursor's speed (this adc input soon be configurable to another GPIO in config).

### TODO
- Add mouse wheel (with a potentiometer)

### Remarks
I'm using the touch functionnality because I simply don't have enough buttons (and it's more more convenient to setup/use ?).
