## A bluetooth mouse peripheric made with an ESP32 devkit and some cables

### Current state
Only moving the cursor works right now (left & right click can be pressed but are never released)

### TODO
- Add click support (with release)
- Add sensisivity support (with a potentiometer)

### Remarks
I'm using the touch functionnality because I simply don't have enough buttons (and it's more more convenient to setup/use ?).
