## A bluetooth mouse peripheric made with an ESP32 devkit and some cables

### Current state
Moving the cursor and clicking (right and left clicks) work right now

### TODO
- Add click support (with release)
- Add sensisivity support (with a potentiometer)
- Add mouse wheel (with a potentiometer)

### Remarks
I'm using the touch functionnality because I simply don't have enough buttons (and it's more more convenient to setup/use ?).
